**Direct Connection to Sita's Mission**:
- **"Reduce onboarding time from months to weeks"**: Comprehensive glossaries create the technical vocabulary map that new developers need to navigate complex systems
- **"3 hours saved per week"**: Eliminates time spent hunting for term definitions and reduces "what does this mean?" interruptions
- **"Cut AI token spend by 15%"**: Clear terminology documentation provides better context for AI coding assistants, reducing clarification queries

**Business Impact**: 
- Captures thousands of long-tail technical searches that competitors miss → increased qualified developer traffic
- Accelerates developer onboarding through comprehensive terminology documentation → faster time-to-productivity
- Reduces support burden by providing self-service technical definitions → improved developer experience

### Beautiful Design
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for consistent, professional design
- **Design System**: Modern card layouts, consistent typography hierarchy, and intuitive navigation
